# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Project

## Project Description

In this project, we aim to conduct a sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Our primary objective is to compare traditional statistical methods against modern AI/ML techniques to evaluate tweets. We plan to analyze the sentiment of tweets stored in the PostgreSQL Twitter database using different approaches and tools. 

### Team Members and Roles

- **Owen Andreasen** 
  - **GitHub/GitLab Username:** andreaseno
  - **Role:** AI/ML sentiment analysis using Python and libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, SciKit-Learn, Scipy, and Torch.
  
- **Justin Park**
  - **GitHub/GitLab Username:** Chang-park
  - **Role:** Conducting traditional statistical analysis primarily using SAS and SAS Text Miner.

### Project Type

This is a sentiment analysis project with a unique angle of comparing  traditional statistics and AI/ML models such as BERT transformers and LSTM networks. Our analysis will include metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision and will consider the detection of sarcasm and complex sentiments.

## Resources

Our analysis will be tested on a custom dataset built using tweets from the PostgreSQL Twitter database. Additionally, we are referencing the following external datasets and resources to aid our research:

**Datasets**
- Twitter Sentiment Dataset [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/twitter-sentiment-dataset)
    - This dataset was a possible training dataset for positive, neutral, negative multiclass models, but the data looked low quality
- Sentiment140 Dataset [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140)
    - This dataset only uses positive and negative classes (no neutral), but the data looked high quality and there are a ton of rows
